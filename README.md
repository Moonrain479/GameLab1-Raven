"Raven" was specifically made for a 1-year-University-Assignment 2023.
It is my first programming-project and game.
All art was made by me.
 
## Abstract

"Raven" is a puzzle-platformer featuring a cat named Raven.
Help him find his way home by guiding him through the buildings. Along the way, you must find and collect various objects scattered around the level. 
These objects must be placed in a way that helps Raven overcome obstacles and reach his destination. 
With its unique level design and charming protagonist, "Raven" offers a delightful, mentally stimulating and relaxing game experience.
